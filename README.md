# Project management dashboard

This web application is a Project Management Dashboard designed to track tasks, assignments, status, and deadlines managed by a team of four members. Each team member is responsible for a specific section: John manages Tasks, Elizabeth handles Assignments, Michael tracks Status, and Emily oversees Deadlines. The dashboard allows adding upcoming tasks and displays previously completed tasks in the admin panel.
