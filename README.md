# Project management dashboard

This web application is a Project Management Dashboard designed to track tasks, assignments, status, and deadlines managed by a team of four members. Each team member is responsible for a specific section: John manages Tasks, Elizabeth handles Assignments, Michael tracks Status, and Emily oversees Deadlines. The dashboard allows adding upcoming tasks and displays previously completed tasks in the admin panel. For new members joining the company, there is a separate task assignment page, which can be viewed from the admin panel.
